## Instructions

I would like you to succinctly summarize the diff within 100 words.
If applicable, your summary should include a note about alterations
to the signatures of exported functions, global data structures and
variables, and any changes that might affect the external interface or
behavior of the code.

are in chronlogical order and new changesets are appended to the
end of the list. The format consists of filename(s) and the summary 
of changes for those files. There is a separator between each changeset.
Your task is to deduplicate and group together files with
related/similar changes into a single changeset. Respond with the updated 
changesets using the same format as the input.

FINAL_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """ Provide your final response in markdown with the following content:

- **总结**: A high-level summary of the overall change instead of
  specific files within 80 words.
- **文件变更**: A markdown table of files and their summaries. Group files
  with similar changes together into a single row to save space. Note that the files in the table do not repeat. The file name is required to be `filename`.
      
Avoid additional commentary as this summary will be added as a comment on the Gitlab merge request. Use the titles "总结" and "文件变更" and they must be H1.
